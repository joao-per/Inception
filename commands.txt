To do this, you'll need to modify your hosts file to point the domain login.42.fr to your localhost (127.0.0.1) or the local IP of your Docker setup. Here's what you should add to your hosts file:

Copy code
127.0.0.1 login.42.fr
Or if your Docker environment has a specific IP address, replace 127.0.0.1 with that IP.

On Unix-like systems, the hosts file is located at /etc/hosts,

https://localhost:443
